Kata - find the average score and return the appropriate grade


Background story


I previously worked in education so translating scores into grades is something very familiar to me! The idea behind this kata is based upon my own experience and itâ€™s an example of how a simple piece of code can save a lot of time. 


Planning


I began by noting down potential ideas and thinking about how viable they would be. I tried to make sure I focused on how easy potential ideas would be to test; for example, I was interested in coming up with a Mad Libs kata but I thought this would be too tricky to test properly in the time limit. 


Once I had a few ideas I investigated Code Wars and LeetCode which gave me an insight into similar problems.


I wanted to produce a simple 2 stage problem as I thought this would make it more challenging and would encourage thorough planning.


When I had chosen my idea I had a go at coding it, to check that the structure and function would be similar to what I had expected. I then focused on testing, it was relatively straightforward to come up with tests for the main categories but I found edge cases more challenging. I used Boundary Value Analysis to check the upper and lower limits and, for this stage, I used Chat GPT for a bit of help in terms of coming up with values. 


Challenges


I found it harder than expected to write the problem as succinctly and clearly as possible, for example, I realised that I needed to clarify what kind of average was required (the mean).


As mentioned previously, I found coming up with adequate tests for edge cases challenging and time consuming.
I also missed some study time this morning which slightly limited the number of tests I could run during the time limit. 


Ideas for extending the problem


I would like to develop the Kata further by calculating the average from a varying amount of scores.


I would also like to experiment with more thorough testing for edge cases.
