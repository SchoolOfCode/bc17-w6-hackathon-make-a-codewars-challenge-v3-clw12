/** 
 * Kata - Average scores
 * Hello challenger! Your task is to work out the mean (average) of the three scores 
 * passed as arguments into the function and to return the letter associated with
 * the average score.

The letter categories for the average scores are as follows:

80 <= score <= 100: 'A'
65 <= score < 80: 'B'
50 <= score < 65: 'C'
35 <= score < 50: 'D'
0 <= score < 50: 'E'

All scores will be integers between 0 and 100. There is no need to check for negative 
numbers or scores greater than 100. 

A few examples: 

findGrade(63, 27, 74) should return 'C' as the mean (average) score of these
three numbers is 54.6, which is in the C category.

findGrade(82, 77, 89) should return 'A' as the mean (average) score of these
three numbers is 82.6, which is in the A category.

export function findGrade(firstScore, secondScore, thirdScore) {
    /** Please write your code here **/
   
}
