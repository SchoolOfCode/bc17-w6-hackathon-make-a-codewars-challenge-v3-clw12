/** 
 * Kata - Average scores
 * Hello challenger! Your task is to work out the mean (average) of the three scores 
 * passed as arguments into the function and to return the letter associated with
 * the average score.

The letter categories for the scores are as follows:

80 <= score <= 100: 'A'
65 <= score < 80: 'B'
50 <= score < 65: 'C'
35 <= score < 50: 'D'
0 <= score < 50: 'E'

All scores will integers between 0 and 100. There is no need to check for negative 
numbers or scores greater than 100. 

A few examples: 

findGrade(63, 27, 74) should return 'C' as the mean (average) score of these
three numbers is 54.6, which is in the C category.

findGrade(82, 77, 89) should return 'A' as the mean (average) score of these
three numbers is 82.6, which is in the A category.

export function findGrade(firstScore, secondScore, thirdScore) {
}
    


findGrade(82, 75, 91)
findGrade(72, 79, 69)
findGrade(52, 71, 41)
findGrade(22, 50, 35)
findGrade(22, 7, 10)
